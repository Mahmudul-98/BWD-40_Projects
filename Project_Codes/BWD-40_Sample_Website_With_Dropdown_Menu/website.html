                <p>The University of Rajshahi is one of the largest universities in the country and the largest with the
                    highest seat of learning in the northern region of Bangladesh. After its foundation on July 6, 1953,
                    the university has been providing higher education and research. The university is located on a
                    753-acre campus on the green premises of Motihar, which is very close to the mighty river Padma and
                    seven km east of the Rajshahi City Center.
                    <br><br>
                    The necessity of a university in the northern part of East Pakistan was felt immediately after the
                    creation of Pakistan. These areas were comparatively lagging behind in higher education, and the
                    University of Dhaka, then the only university of its kind in the country, being situated in the
                    capital, was not very easily accessible to the students of this part. Following a popular demand for
                    a university in this region, the government prepared a feasibility report, and Rajshahi was found
                    suitable for establishing the same. The Rajshahi University Act 1953 (East Bengal Act XV of 1953)
                    was passed by the East Pakistan provincial assembly on March 31, 1953. Bara Kuthi, an 18th century
                    Dutch trading house, was made the administration building. Dr. Itrat Hossain Zeberi was the first
                    Vice-Chancellor of the University. Its normal academic activities began in 1954. During the early
                    days of its inception, classes were held at Rajshahi Government College. In 1961, the university
                    moved to its present campus.
                    <br><br>
                    The university’s 59 departments are organized into twelve faculties. It has six institutes, of which
                    two (IBA and IER) have undergrad and postgraduate programs. The University of Rajshahi is considered
                    as one of the top research universities in Bangladesh. Recently, researchers from this university
                    have made substantial contributions and played a key role in bringing back the ancient Bangladeshi
                    Muslin fiber. The researchers of this university have also created the country’s first and only
                    “snake database”, including snakes’ venom and their toxicity. The university has a strong alumni
                    community around Bangladesh and abroad.
